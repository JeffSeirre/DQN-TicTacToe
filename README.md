# Reinforcement Learning - A DQN agent learning to play TicTacToe.
The game environment is custom built and used to train the neural network against random moves. The network learns about legal moves (can't play in occupied fields), then improves on strategy.

# Play agains the trained neural network!
You can play a game against the NN at https://tictactoe-ai.streamlit.app/

# Next steps
Build an extension to NxN playing fields with a winning condition of M symbols in a row for arbitrary N, M.
