# A DQN agent learning to play TicTacToe.
The game environment is custom built and used to train the neural network against random moves. The network learns about legal moves (can't play in occupied fields), then improves on strategy.

# Next steps
Build a web interface where a player can play against the trained network.
Build an extension to NxN playing fields with a winning condition of M symbols in a row for arbitrary N, M.
